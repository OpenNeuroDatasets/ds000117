1.1.0 2025-01-06
  - Reconverted MRI data from DICOM with Heudiconv
1.0.6 2024-04-22
  - Update IntendedFor fields to be subject-relative.
1.0.5 2021-09-28
  - Removed task entity from coordsystem.json files
1.0.4 2020-12-18
  - Corrected stimuli (and added a few more notes about subject numbers in different versions of dataset)
1.0.3	2018-11-26

	- Updated task-facerecognition_bold.json and acq-mprage_T1w.json with more fields (eg PhaseEncodingDirection and SliceTiming). Added README note about reduced volumes for sub-10, run-09. Deleted session-specific *channels.tsv and *json files for MEG sub-emptyroom (which were labelled with "task-facerecognition" rather than "task-noise" like *.fif files, causing BIDS Validator error). Added a single *channels.tsv and *.json at higher level of sub-emptyroom, which should be inherited)

1.0.2	2018-09-30

	- Moved *_meg.json and *_channels.tsv to session level 
	- Various edits to *_coordsystem.json and *_meg.json files
	- Added acquisition dates of corresponding empty room scan to *scans.tsv
	- Copied metadata from *_meg.json files to derivatives/
