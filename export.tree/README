This dataset was obtained from the OpenNeuro project (https://www.openneuro.org). Accession #: ds000117

The same dataset is also available here: ftp://ftp.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/personal/rik.henson/wakemandg_hensonrn/, but in a non-BIDS format (which may be easier to download by subject rather than by modality)

Note that it is a subset of the data available on OpenfMRI (http://www.openfmri.org; Accession #: ds000117).


Description:  Multi-subject, multi-modal (sMRI+fMRI+MEG+EEG) neuroimaging dataset on face processing

Please cite the following reference if you use these data:

The data have been used in several publications including, for example:

func/
-----
Unlike in v1-v3 of this dataset, the first two (dummy) volumes have now been removed (as stated in *.json), so event onset times correctly refer to t=0 at start of third volume 

Note that, owing to scanner error, Subject 10 only has 170 volumes in last run (Run 9) (hence the BIDS warning of some onsets in events.tsv file being later than the data)

meg/
----
Three anatomical fiducials were digitized for aligning the MEG with the MRI: the nasion 
(lowest depression between the eyes) and the left and right ears (lowest depression 
between the tragus and the helix, above the tragus). This procedure is illustrated here:
http://neuroimage.usc.edu/brainstorm/CoordinateSystems#Subject_Coordinate_System_.28SCS_.2F_CTF.29
and in task-facerecognition_fidinfo.pdf 

The following triggers are included in the .fif files and are also used in the “trigger” column of the meg and bold events files:

Trigger            Label               Simplified Label

5         Initial Famous Face               FAMOUS
6         Immediate Repeat Famous Face      FAMOUS
7         Delayed Repeat Famous Face        FAMOUS
13        Initial Unfamiliar Face           UNFAMILIAR
14        Immediate Repeat Unfamiliar Face  UNFAMILIAR
15        Delayed Repeat Unfamiliar Face    UNFAMILIAR
17        Initial Scrambled Face            SCRAMBLED
18        Immediate Repeat Scrambled Face   SCRAMBLED
19        Delayed Repeat Scrambled Face     SCRAMBLED

stimuli/meg/
------------
The .bmp files correspond to those described in the text. There are 6 additional images in this directory, which were used in the practice experiment to familiarize participants with the task (hence some more BIDS validator warnings)

stimuli/mri/
------------
The .bmp files correspond to those described in the text.
	
Defacing
--------
Defacing of MPRAGE T1 images was performed by the submitter. A subset of subjects have given consent for non-defaced versions to be shared - in which case, please contact rik.henson@mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk.
 
Quality Control
---------------
Mriqc was run on the dataset. Results are located in derivatives/mriqc. Learn more about it here: https://mriqc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

Relationship of Subject Numbering relative to other versions of Dataset
------------

There are multiple versions of the dataset available on the web (see notes above), and these entailed a renumbering of the subjects for various reasons. Here are all the versions and how to match subjects between them (plus some rationale and history for different versions):
 
1. Original Paper (N=19): Wakeman & Henson (2015): doi:10.1038/sdata.2015.1 
    Number refers to order that tested (and some, eg 4, 7, 13 etc were excluded for not completing both MRI and MEG sessions)
 
2. openfMRI, renumbered from paper: http://openfmri.org/s3-browser/?prefix=ds000117/ds000117_R0.1.1/uncompressed/
    Numbers 1-19 just made contiguous
 
3. FTP subset of N=16: ftp: ftp://ftp.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/personal/rik.henson/wakemandg_hensonrn/  
    This set was used for SPM Courses
    Designed to illustrate multimodal integration, so wanted good MRI+MEG+EEG data for all subjects
    Removed original subject_01 and subject_06 because bad EEG data; subject_19 because poor EEG and fMRI data
    (And renumbered subject_14 for some reason).
 
4. Current OpenNeuro subset N=16 used for (BIDS): https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds000117 
    OpenNeuro was rebranding of openfMRI, and enforced BIDS format
    Since this version designed to illustrate multi-modal BIDS, kept same numbering as FTP
